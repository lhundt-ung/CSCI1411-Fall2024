# Assignment 9
**Script Language:** Python

**VM:** CS1411-Kali

## Goal
Your final Python scripting assignment tests your knowledge working with Objects. Two
object classes called firewall and packet have been provided. Your task is to complete
the 5 questions in a9.py. Question 4 requires a small modification to firewall.py to complete successfully.

You will need to read through and understand how the objects are constructed and implemented in order to utilize them. 

Once completed, you will need to turn in a9-<username>.py and firewall-<username>.py in D2L.
 
Good luck!
